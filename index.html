	<h2>CS Interview Practice</h2>
	Cool Websites:<br/>
	<a href="hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a><br/>
	<a href="wcipeg.com">WCIPEG</a><br/>
	<a href="dmoj.ca">DMOJ</a><br/>
	<a href="train.usaco.org">USACO Training Pages</a><br/>
	<a href="uhunt.felix-halim.net">UVa Hunting</a><br/>
	<br/><br/>
	Recommendation: To learn algorithms, use USACO Training Pages. Then try solving problems on the other sites. UVa Hunting is really nice for problem organization, WCIPEG and DMOJ have the highest quality problems, and HackerRank is good for contests. I have also heard a lot about LeetCode for interview problems, but have never used it personally so I can't say anything for or against it.

	Here are the slides from today: <a href="http://puu.sh/w38dj/05a03e5aca.pptx">slides</a>
	<br/><br/>
	Here are the solutions to the problems we solved today:
	<br/><br/>
	<a href="http://wcipeg.com/problem/wc99p2">Mission Impossible</a>: <a href="http://puu.sh/w38mW/88447296c4.cpp">Solution</a><br/>
	<a href="http://wcipeg.com/problem/graph1p2">Shortest Path</a>: <a href="http://puu.sh/w38nZ/065e0c1578.cpp">Solution</a><br/>
	<a href="http://wcipeg.com/problem/graph3p1">Travelling Salesman</a>: <a href="http://puu.sh/w38pH/8ea22610b2.cpp">Solution</a><br/>
	<br/><br/>
	We additionally solved one additional problem after the majority of people had left (Not graph theory related, but probably good interview practice): Given an array of N integers, find indices i, j minimizing |A[i] - A[j]|. Your solution should run in O(N log N) time.

	If anyone is interested in a second session focusing on dynamic programming, please vote on the strawpoll below for the date that works best for you. I will attempt to update my website with the results of the poll and tenative location by, say, Wednesday.

	I additionally found an old contest on my hard drive I've never used before. It consists of 3 problems of varying difficulty, though I don't think anything harder than the upper end of interview problems. If people are interested, the second review session could start with a 1 hour "mock" interviw contest, (ECOO format, team optional) in which you could get a chance to practice on some problems. If you are interested, let me know on this strawpoll:
